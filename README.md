# Analyzing and Predicting Trends in Academic Research

## ðŸ“œ Overview
The primary goal of our project is to analyze and predict trends in academic research over time, focusing
on identifying trending topics and mapping collaboration patterns among researchers across different
fields. This project leverages data from the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) to identify the most
popular research topics, track their evolution, and visualize these trends dynamically. Additionally, we
aim to investigate co-authorship patterns to uncover interdisciplinary collaboration networks, revealing
how different research fields are interconnected through joint efforts.
